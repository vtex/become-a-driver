# Career Path

This section will detail the career path of the Individual Contributor (IC) engineer track.

Each level will start with a radar chart based on the Engineering Competencies, Key Takeaway points (in a nutshell, what someone at this level does and how they behave) and Common Pitfalls (common mistakes that people do at this level). Then the main text will discuss the main challenges, everyday routine, and some reflection on transitions in place. The [Skill Acquisition Process](skill-acquisition-process.md) is the basis for the radar chart's X-axis.
