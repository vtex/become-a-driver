![Senior Staff Engineer radar chart based on Engineering Competences](assets/l5.png)

## Key Takeaways

* Focuses on consolidating finder skills to handle increasingly complex and ambiguous problems
* Sharpens ability to identify relevant problems, prioritize them, and propose balanced solutions considering short and long-term goals, as well as local and global perspectives
* Establishes expertise in specific engineering areas, and increases knowledge-sharing and mentorship opportunities.
* Collaborates with senior colleagues and engage in initiatives proposed by drivers to strengthen your support network

## Common Pitfalls

* Focuses too much on technical tasks and ignores strategic leadership responsibilities
* Has difficulty delegating and empowering other engineers
* Has challenges in collaborating and communicating effectively with different departments and teams
* Neglects the importance of staying updated with industry developments and best practices
* Fails to align technical decisions with overall business goals and strategic objectives

## Discussion

At this level, you will focus on consolidating and maturing your finder skills. Problems will become increasingly ambiguous, complex, and large in scope; some may even impact the entire engineering organization. However, there will be no major changes in how you work compared to the L4 level; the difference is on the impact of your work at this even more extensive scope, complexity, and ambiguity.

You will continue to work as a finder for most of your time, so you will sharpen your ability to identify the most relevant problems and prioritize them accordingly. You should be able to propose solutions that balance short and long-term goals and consider the local and global impact. It's important to continue developing your strategic vision and influence to keep growing.

At this level, you will have established yourself as an expert in one or more areas of engineering. This will allow you to connect with more people and improve your skills in sharing knowledge, while also continuing to mentor others, regardless of whether they are engineers or not. As time passes, you will notice that your horizons have expanded, so start filling this room.

In addition, you will eventually be involved in initiatives with more senior colleagues (whether engineers or managers) and start collaborating on ideas proposed by those already at the driver stage. This type of learning will be essential for your ongoing development and strengthen your support network.

Your concern with developing people will be even greater, as well as your involvement with hiring processes, sharpening your vision for process improvements, participating in hiring events, and engaging in preliminary conversations with candidates. Additionally, you will be thinking about ways to make the company more attractive to potential hires.

By the end of this level, you will feel comfortable designing and implementing solutions with high ambiguity, involving communication between various systems and creating a collaborative environment for the engineering teams involved. The proposed solutions need to be robust and balance short and long-term visions, as well as local and global perspectives.

Moreover, you will be able to identify and address design problems, whether in the products you work on daily or those presented to you through a design document.
