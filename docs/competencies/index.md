# Engineering Competencies

Welcome to this document that explores the fundamental pillars with a subset of competencies for success in our engineering journey. Here, we will dive into a set of essential skills and principles that will help us thrive in our respective fields.

In the engineering field, developing competencies goes beyond technical knowledge! It requires cultivating a broad mindset and a set of skills that enable us to tackle challenges with confidence and excellence. 

By honing and integrating these competencies into our career track, we will be able to face obstacles with resilience and achieve extraordinary results.

This document explores each of these competencies in detail, providing insights to build a solid foundation that enables continuous growth and the development of a mindset that guides us toward success in our professional goals.

It’s important to emphasize that each person has a unique path, and the application of these pillars may vary according to individual context and needs. Therefore, it encourages you to explore and adapt these concepts to your own journey, finding the balance that best fits your aspirations and goals.

Are you ready to build a solid foundation and reach new heights of success? Let's dive into the fundamental pillars that will propel us toward a thriving and fulfilling career. Let's get started!

## Pillars

To make it smoother and also have joy in this reading, the pillars below are presented in an analogy with a forest, where each individual has a contribution to keep our engineering field alive.

## Plant Trees

A forest thrives because of its trees! The act of planting trees of various types, sizes, and shapes is instrumental in creating a rich and diverse ecosystem. Each tree contributes its unique qualities, adding to the beauty and vitality of the forest. Just as every tree plays a vital role, each individual's efforts and contributions are essential in building a thriving and diverse engineering ecosystem. By planting trees we’ll address the following competencies: [Problem-Solving Strategies](plant-trees.md#problem-solving-strategies), [Data-oriented decision making](plant-trees.md#data-oriented-decision-making), [Documentation](plant-trees.md#documentation),  and [Quality Consciousness](plant-trees.md#quality-consciousness).

## Flourish Your Neighborhood

Looking at those around you with empathy, understanding their individual circumstances, and finding ways to connect with them. This connection can be fostered verbally, in writing, in person or remotely. By nurturing together these connections, we can cultivate an environment where everyone can grow and flourish by focusing on the following competencies: [Effective Communication](flourish-your-neighborhood.md#effective-communication), [Mediation](flourish-your-neighborhood.md#mediation), [Influence](flourish-your-neighborhood.md#influence), and [Knowledge Sharing](flourish-your-neighborhood.md#knowledge-sharing)

## See the Whole Forest

When we focus solely on a single tree, we fail to see the entire forest! This pillar explores how to attain a broad and long-lasting vision for our platform. Understanding how to balance the present and the future, the local and the global, is essential for the collective good. Considering the bigger picture, we can make informed decisions that benefit the long-term success of our platform and positively impact the wider community, by addressing these competencies: [Problem Focus](see-the-whole-forest.md#problem-focus), [Embracing Experimentation](see-the-whole-forest.md#embracing-experimentation), [Strategic Vision](see-the-whole-forest.md#strategic-vision), and [Owner's Mindset](see-the-whole-forest.md#owners-mindset)
