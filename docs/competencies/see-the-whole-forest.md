## Problem Focus

The first step to adopting a problem-focused approach is to understand the specific problem under discussion. Typically, you'll spend much time in discussions establishing the boundaries and relevant elements of the problem, and then, in some cases, defining a solution becomes a simple step.

It's important to note that not all problems have simple solutions, even when the context is well-defined. One common pitfall is falling in love with the given solution. No matter how simple or sophisticated the solution is, it'll only be relevant as long as the problem exists. When the situation changes or evolves, refocusing on the problem is crucial.

As you progress in your career, your ability to think abstractly will also increase, and you will encounter problems with high levels of ambiguity. Another valuable tip is to consider breaking down large and complex problems into smaller and more manageable ones.

## Embracing Experimentation

Experimentation is critical to expanding your portfolio. It serves as a catalyst for exploring new avenues, challenging existing assumptions, eliminating biases, and gaining insight into the market's direction, allowing you to anticipate emerging trends and stay ahead of the curve.

Another essential aspect is the ability to conduct well-founded research using replicable methodologies that contribute to future decision-making.

Do not limit yourself to experimenting within your platform's familiar boundaries. It's important to be bold, think outside the box, and break down barriers to encourage innovation!

## Strategic Vision

The strategic vision is the ability to connect with a problem and consider possibilities to guide a path that maximizes benefit in the current scenario. It also helps you to stay grounded and prevents you from getting lost in a world of experimentation that does not lead to results.
You can use this skill in various contexts, such as making design decisions, integrating systems, or providing guidance to the entire engineering department.

Another key aspect is evaluating which problems will genuinely have a relevant positive impact on your ecosystem. You may encounter countless problems along the way, so knowing how to prioritize which ones to address first is a valuable skill. Developing this skill takes time, so keep practicing!

## Owner's Mindset

The owner's mindset emerges when you comprehend and embrace the company's goals. 

The first step in understanding strategy is to practice empathy, enabling you to see things from someone else's perspective. Once you internalize this understanding, the next step is to align others with the purpose. A fascinating phenomenon occurs when everyone is aligned: as individuals know where to go, each person's autonomy level increases, providing greater freedom in daily tasks.

Furthermore, as you advance in your career and gain more experience, your perspective will broaden, enabling you to see beyond the immediate tasks at hand. As a result, you will begin to face new challenges!
