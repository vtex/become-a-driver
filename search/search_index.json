Someone who consistently works as a Finder can also take on the role of an Implementer or Solver. A person in one stage is expected to be proficient in at least the previous stage. For example, a Solver is expected to excel as an Implementer, and a Driver is not only a great Finder, but is likely a proficient Solver as well.</p>"},{"location":"journey/#implementer","title":"Implementer","text":"<p>As an implementer, we're getting in touch with languages and frameworks, diving deep into design patterns, and getting our hands dirty almost all the time.

Finding problems is not hard in companies like ours, but determining whether their solution will have a long-term impact can be challenging. The answer typically will be in multiple systems or modules. At this point, it's essential to expand our horizons and embrace experimentation, looking for new opportunities.

However, you need to be intentional and connect different activities to something that makes sense to have cohesion with your team's goals, area, and career.</p> <p>When you face situations where you have demands that do not connect, review your decisions and align with your leaders to have an action plan to reorganize your work. Saying no or stopping doing something unrelated to your objectives is not a sign of lack of commitment but rather a sign of pragmatism, of completing essential things on time. You must develop self-management skills to avoid being a bottleneck or overloading with multiple activities/projects.</p> <p>This dynamism will make your day less linear at each journey step. Naturally, you may feel less productive. This lack of linearity is due to increased scope during this growth. While you are in the implementer or solver stages, you're expected to be very focused on a single team's routine. However, when entering the finder phase, it will be rare to keep that routine, and your scope of action tends to be in one or more business verticals.

A helpful tip is to consider documentation as something to build together with the implementation, not just at the end. Creating clear and straightforward code can be a form of documentation. Remember that code is usually written only once, but it's read multiple times, so building code with good readability is essential.

Documenting something frees up time. Instead of having to explain the same thing to multiple people, you can simply share the content. Creating a holistic view of the platform is critical to facilitate onboarding new team members and planning changes across multiple products. It also gives people the freedom to explore our platform.</p> <p>It's important to consider the audience that will be consuming the documentation. Take some time to think about the best format and how to convey the point being documented. Typically, documentation is associated with written pages, but if you find that recording a video, podcast,  or even a picture of a diagram on a napkin would be better for a particular topic, go for it! The idea is to make it easier to consume and maintain.</p> <p>When it comes to storytelling, you don't need to prepare to write a book or a college essay. The idea is that good stories tend to stick in people's minds, so use some of your time to think about small details like whether to write in the first or third person, whether to use a formal or informal tone, whether to use a known structure (like a six-page or one-page document) or define a new format.</p> <p>Finally, documentation can permeate the entire development process, from brainstorming a feature to creating a design document, defining acceptance criteria for backlog stories, creating internal documentation for the team, or even documentation for the end customer of that functionality. Don't limit yourself to the idea that documentation is something that only happens at the end of the development process. Find good opportunities and go for it!</p>"},{"location":"competencies/plant-trees/#quality-consciousness","title":"Quality consciousness","text":"<p>Quality consciousness permeates the entire process of delivering value. From refactoring confusing code, to improving acceptance criteria for a user story, to performing detailed code reviews, to increasing testing, to monitoring metrics, rethinking the delivery process because of a critical release, or trying to understand how to improve internal processes when things do not go well, reducing unnecessary dependencies and much more.</p> <p>Broadening your view of quality is essential. It's about finding the right balance for each situation rather than getting stuck in rules that have no impact. The idea is to think about quality at every stage.</p>"},{"location":"competencies/see-the-whole-forest/","title":"See the Whole Forest","text":""},{"location":"competencies/see-the-whole-forest/#problem-focus","title":"Problem Focus","text":"<p>The first step to adopting a problem-focused approach is to understand the specific problem under discussion. Typically, you'll spend much time in discussions establishing the boundaries and relevant elements of the problem, and then, in some cases, defining a solution becomes a simple step.</p> <p>It's important to note that not all problems have simple solutions, even when the context is well-defined. One common pitfall is falling in love with the given solution. No matter how simple or sophisticated the solution is, it'll only be relevant as long as the problem exists. When the situation changes or evolves, refocusing on the problem is crucial.</p> <p>As you progress in your career, your ability to think abstractly will also increase, and you will encounter problems with high levels of ambiguity. Another valuable tip is to consider breaking down large and complex problems into smaller and more manageable ones.</p>"},{"location":"competencies/see-the-whole-forest/#embracing-experimentation","title":"Embracing Experimentation","text":"<p>Experimentation is critical to expanding your portfolio. It serves as a catalyst for exploring new avenues, challenging existing assumptions, eliminating biases, and gaining insight into the market's direction, allowing you to anticipate emerging trends and stay ahead of the curve.</p> <p>Another essential aspect is the ability to conduct well-founded research using replicable methodologies that contribute to future decision-making.</p> <p>Do not limit yourself to experimenting within your platform's familiar boundaries. It's important to be bold, think outside the box, and break down barriers to encourage innovation!</p>"},{"location":"competencies/see-the-whole-forest/#strategic-vision","title":"Strategic Vision","text":"<p>The strategic vision is the ability to connect with a problem and consider possibilities to guide a path that maximizes benefit in the current scenario. It also helps you to stay grounded and prevents you from getting lost in a world of experimentation that does not lead to results. You can use this skill in various contexts, such as making design decisions, integrating systems, or providing guidance to the entire engineering department.</p> <p>Another key aspect is evaluating which problems will genuinely have a relevant positive impact on your ecosystem. You may encounter countless problems along the way, so knowing how to prioritize which ones to address first is a valuable skill. Developing this skill takes time, so keep practicing!</p>"},{"location":"competencies/see-the-whole-forest/#owners-mindset","title":"Owner's Mindset","text":"<p>The owner's mindset emerges when you comprehend and embrace the company's goals. </p> <p>The first step in understanding strategy is to practice empathy, enabling you to see things from someone else's perspective. Once you internalize this understanding, the next step is to align others with the purpose. A fascinating phenomenon occurs when everyone is aligned: as individuals know where to go, each person's autonomy level increases, providing greater freedom in daily tasks.</p> <p>Furthermore, as you advance in your career and gain more experience, your perspective will broaden, enabling you to see beyond the immediate tasks at hand. As a result, you will begin to face new challenges!</p>"}]}
